    <p class="header">About me</p>
    <p class="content">Hi, Nice to meet you! 
        <br>I'm NoctiVision, a high school student and a quiet photographer. I love capturing peaceful, silent moments in landscapes, starry skies, and city nights. I shoot mostly with my trusty Canon EOS 80D — it's an older camera, but it's been with me through a lot, and I'm excited to upgrade my gear someday. Colors really matter to me, especially the way warm and cool tones can create contrast and mood in a photo. I pay close attention to the histogram and tone curves to get just the right feel, and for astrophotography, I use Siril to carefully process my images.
        <br>My name, NoctiVision, comes from the idea of seeking light in darkness. It also nods to the Nikon 58mm f/0.95 S Noct lens, one of the most special lenses ever made — even though I don't use it myself, it inspires me. For me, photography is more than just taking pictures; it's about capturing memories, telling stories, and reflecting feelings. I hope to keep photography as my hobby forever — a quiet way to explore and share the world as I see it.</p>
